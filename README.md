# Hi
This is a repo containing a collection of programs made to automate very specific situations I've encountered

## Youtube Transcript
If you've ever wanted to copy a transcript from youtube but you notice that you also copy the timestamps? This code can remove any timestamps you find as long as it follows this format.

It works by removing every even line. You place your text in the In.txt file and the changed text will be output to the Out.txt
Make sure when running the code it's on the same directory where the text files are found

# Installation
For linux users you can run the code with the executable on a terminal
For windows users you can download the code and compile it
